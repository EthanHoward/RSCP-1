## INFO
> extension/s .rsw .rw
## SYTAX
> $incl("") => includes a library, currently the only library is "Sys" however, even if not imported, it will still work
> Sys.in/out.undefined() - System, used for console outputs and inputs and possibly at some point, piping to another process 
> "void" void foo(void){func-content} returns nothing and errors if a "return" is found in the func
## INTENTIONS
> Language and format similar to that of javascript and java 
> a few other things too:
> this.parent will get the class above if it's in a class/func
