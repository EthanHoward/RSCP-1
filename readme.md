# AVAScript 
#### AVAScript is my own custom [interpreted] language which hopefully will be based on the format of JavaScript and the ability to define specific data types like C++ [C Plus Plus] or Java [Probably which is easiest]
> Roadmap -
>>> [LIKELY] Basic syntax parsing
>>> [HOPEFULLY] implement types and other parts of code such as wildcards, lambadas or JavaScript Arrow Functions foo("test", (a1, a2) => {body})
>>> [POSSIBLY] A compiler 
>> Syntax -
>>> semicolons used to end lines
>>> public static void fname() {};
>>> public void () {};
>>> types originally implemented likely follow from C++ or Java
>>> constant <type> foo = <value>;
