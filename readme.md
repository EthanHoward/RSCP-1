# AVAScript 
#### AVAScript is my own custom [interpreted] language which hopefully will be based on the format of JavaScript and the ability to define specific data types like C++ [C Plus Plus] or Java
> Roadmap - <br />
>>> [LIKELY] Basic syntax parsing <br />
>>> [HOPEFULLY] implement types and other parts of code such as wildcards, lambadas or JavaScript Arrow Functions foo("test", (a1, a2) => {body}) <br />
>>> [POSSIBLY] A compiler <br /> 
>> Syntax - <br />
>>> semicolons used to end lines <br />
>>> public static void fname() {}; <br />
>>> public void () {}; <br />
>>> types originally implemented likely follow from C++ or Java <br />
>>> constant <type> foo = <value>; <br />
